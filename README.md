#### What is the purpose of this mod??
This is a submod to address the compatibility issues with 'The Road to 56'. Make sure you have 'The Road to 56' with "Pipe's Formable Puppets" enabled in your playset when using this submod.
#### What is Pipe's Formable Puppets?
In the base game, the only nation which can create puppets from decisions is Germany with its Reichskommissariats. This mod attempts to address this, by adding new formable puppets which nations can create if they occupy certain states. The newly added puppets have a custom autonomy level named "Military Administration" which mirrors the effects of the base game "Reichskommissariat".\
